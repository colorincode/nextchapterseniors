We are now a year past their move-in date to a senior living environment, and our mom expresses gratitude every day for having moved.

My stepmother was experiencing cognitive decline but wasn't ready for a  memory care facility. She needed an "enhanced" assisted living arrangement. I was referred to Melette at Next Chapter. Melette took the time to listen, ask important questions, and fully understand not just our situation, but my stepmother's personality, lifestyle, likes, and dislikes. Melette helped me find a terrific place for my stepmother and helped me navigate the entire process. Melette continued to provide support and much later, when it became time for my stepmother to move to a memory care facility, Melette was there to help us again. Melette is absolutely a godsend. I don't know what I would have done without her.</blockquote>
