            <p class="content--paragraphtext" style="text-align: center;">My three-step process is designed to make finding a senior living community—like independent living, assisted living, or memory care in Silicon Valley—simple and stress-free. Here's how we'll work together:

                    <p><span class="howitworks__list--span">1. Assess Needs & Explore Options Available Near You </span>
            We start with a free consultation where I listen to your story. I assess your or your loved one's needs—physical, cognitive, social, and financial—and discuss preferences like location and lifestyle. Using my expertise, I research and recommend   communities that align with your priorities, providing a clear action plan for visits.</p>

                    I join you on tours of potential communities, asking the right questions to evaluate their suitability. From assisted living in Silicon Valley to memory care facilities, I advocate for you, ensuring each option meets your needs. Together, we'll review our findings and select the community that feels just right.

                    Once you've chosen a community, I help coordinate the move and follow up after placement to ensure everything exceeds expectations. My goal? Your loved one's comfort, safety, and happiness in their new home.
